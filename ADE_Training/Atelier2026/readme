The VNFDs in this repository are provided for teaching and experimentation purposes only.
They are not intended to model realistic 5G Network Functions, nor current industrial deployments.

In particular, they rely on VM-based VNFs, whereas most real 5G systems are today implemented using cloud-native, container-based architectures.
The descriptors intentionally simplify functional, architectural, and operational aspects in order to focus on NSD design and orchestration concepts.
